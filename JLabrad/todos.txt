General
- try to write things as interfaces, rather than concrete types.
- implement connection object, server, client, etc. as beans (ala delphi API)

Client
- add some message dispatching capabilities
    - in what thread should messages be handled?  This only works if there is a message dispatcher
    - best thing is to just use SwingUtilities.invokeLater
    - have a bean interface that fires MessageEvent
- polish interface, using Delphi API as a reference
- provide a means to clear the server/setting cache

Data
- add get* and set* methods that do not check types for use with vectorization

Server
- create annotations to mark server methods
- have connection bean fire RequestEvent

GUI
- add swing compatibility,
  in particular the ability to fire events when requests complete or messages are received
- see what can be done about using the event loop (AWT or Swing) without a GUI (EventQueue)

Examples
- write some example clients and servers
