General
- try to write things as interfaces, rather than concrete types.

Client
- add some message dispatching capabilities
    - in what thread should messages be handled?  This only works if there is a message dispatcher
- polish interface, using Delphi API as a reference
- provide a means to clear the server/setting cache.

Data
- methods for vectorized array setting
- methods for quick creation of basic data types
- method to copy (clone?) a Data object
- method to construct a cluster from a bunch of other data objects (by copying them?)

Server
- create annotations to mark server methods

GUI
- add swing compatibility,
  in particular the ability to fire events when requests complete or messages are received
- see what can be done about using the event loop (AWT or Swing) without a GUI

Examples
- write some example clients and servers
