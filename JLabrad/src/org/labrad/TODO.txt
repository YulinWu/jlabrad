JLabrad TODOs:

Server
- global server object
- message handlers (per context or global)
- create server bean
- have connection bean fire RequestEvent
- make server class BE the context object (static vs. instance methods and vars)

Deployment
- how to deploy JLabrad to developers
- how to deploy apps for desktop
- how to deploy apps with jnlp
- provide ssh tunneling capabilities

Client
- provide a means to clear the server/setting cache

Data
- add get* and set* methods that do not check types for use with vectorization

General
- flatten/unflatten data outside of network threads, so exceptions will not kill the them
- try to write things as interfaces, rather than concrete types.
- implement connection object, server, client, etc. as beans (ala delphi API)

Examples
- write some example clients and servers
